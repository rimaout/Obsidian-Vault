## Multi line strings

- **| (Literal block style)**: Preserves all newlines and whitespace. Every new line in your source stays a new line.
    
- **> (Folded block style)**: Converts newlines in the source into spaces, except for double newlines (which become real newlines). Good for wrapping long paragraphs.
    
- **|- and >-**: Work like | and > but “chomp” the final newline character. So the block won’t add an extra newline at the end.
