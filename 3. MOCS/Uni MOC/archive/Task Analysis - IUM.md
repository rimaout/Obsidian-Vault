## Introduzione

Task Analysis is the study of the way people perform their activities to archive their goals.

Aim is to determine:
- what they do (steps)
- what things they use (artifacts)
- how well they succeed (goals)

>[!warning] Needs vs Goals
>
>Needs are the driving force behind goals, for example: `improve well-being (need), set the goal of exercising (goal)`.
>
>- *Multiple Goals* can derive from a *single Need*
>- Goals are a concrete form of needs
>
>*Context influences Goals*, but not Needs: goals vary depending available resources, but the underlying needs remain the same

>[!example] Task Example (Clean The House)
>
>**Steps:**
>- get the vacuum cleaner out
>- clean the rooms
>- when the dust bag gets full, empty it
>- put the vacuum cleaner and tools away
>
>Must know and use diﬀerent **artifacts**:
>- vacuum cleaners, their attachments, dust bags
>- cupboards, rooms ...
>
>**Goals** depend on the point of view:
>- Removing dust? -> *narrow goal*
>- Tidying up the house after a party?
>- Hosting people for the dinner?
>- Having a satisfying evening? -> *wide goal*

## Why Task Analysis?

**Task rappresentation:** A task can be represented as a structured set of activities required, used, or believed to be necessary to achieve a goal using a particular technology.

**What we want to learn**:
- The goals of the user (what's trying to achieve)
- What users actually do to achieve those goals
- How users are influenced by their physical environment
- How users previous knowledge and experience influence:
	- How they think about their work
	- The workflow they follow to perform their tasks
	- The pain points they experience to perform the tasks

**How to use these informations:**
- Identifying the tasks that your application must support
- Refining or re-defining your app’s navigation or search
- Application requirements gathering
- Developing your content strategy and app structure
- The initial stages of Prototyping
- Performing usability testing

## Examples

>[!note] Health app example
>
>Needs/goals:
>- monitor my health
>- better organize my time
>
>Derived tasks:
>- entering health data into a digital tracking system
>- setting reminders for daily exercise
>
>Poorly defined tasks:
>- improve diet (not operational, too vague)
>- use the medical app (too generic and tied to a specific interface)
>
>Derived actions:
>- measure your health parameters, such as heart rate or blood pressure, using a tool or device that is convenient for you
>- record the data in a way that allows for easy review later (e.g., writing it in a log, using a physical or digital tracking system)

>[!note] Uber Example
>
>Need for convenient transportation:
>- The user wants a quick and easy way to get from point A to point B without the hassle of finding public transportation (😔🚃) or driving themselves.
>- **Task:** arrange transportation from one location to another; the app allows the user to request a ride by defining their starting point and destination, and it matches them with a nearby driver
>
>Need for safety during travel:
>- The user wants to feel safe while traveling, whether through vetted drivers, real-time tracking, or ensuring someone knows their location.
>- **Task:** verify driver details and monitor the ride's progress; the app provides information about the driver, such as their identity and vehicle details, and oﬀers the ability to track the vehicle's real-time location during the trip
>
>Need for cost-eﬀective transportation:
>- The user wants to balance convenience with aﬀordability and ensure they get a reasonably priced ride.
>- **Task:** evaluate transportation options based on cost and availability; the app allows the user to compare diﬀerent transportation options (e.g., shared rides, private rides) and provides fare estimates, helping the user make a decision based on their budget
