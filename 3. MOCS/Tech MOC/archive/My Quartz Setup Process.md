This website is built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a tool that transforms your Markdown notes into a static website. On this page, I've outlined every step I took to make the site look and behave as you see it.

Most of the setup follows the official [Quartz documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/#-get-started), but I've also done some modification mainly on the colors and page layouts. One thing I did differently was use [[Git Submodules]] to store my content. This means that my website's content ([my obsidian vault](https://github.com/rimaout/Obsidian-Vault)) is kept in a separate repository.

## Steps

>[!note] Clone Repository
>```shell
>git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
>cd quartz
>npm i
>npx quartz create
>```

>[!note] Add Git Submodule
>
>
>Add [[Git Submodules|Git Submodule]] as content:
>1. Go in Quartz directory
>2. Run: 
>	```shell
>	git submodule add https://github.com/username/repo.git content/vault
>	git commit -m "Added a new submodule for obsidian notes"
>	```
>	
>>[!warning] How to update the content
>>
>>**Simple Method:**
>>In this method we have to manually update the submodule in the content directory:
>>1. Go in Obsidian vault, commit and push all changers
>>2. Go to Quartz directory
>>3. Run: `git submodule update --remote content/vault` to update submodule in content directory
>>4. Run `npx quartz sync` to push the changes
>>   
>>**Advanced Method:**
>>In this method we use a workflow to automagicaly update the submodule each time the repo of the submodule is modified.
