This website is built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a tool that transforms your Markdown notes into a static website. 

On this page, I've outlined every step I took to make the site look and behave as you see it.

Most of the setup follows the official [Quartz documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/#-get-started), but I've also done some modification mainly on the colours and page layouts.

One thing I did differently was use [[Git Submodules]] to store my content. This means that my website's content ([my obsidian vault](https://github.com/rimaout/Obsidian-Vault)) is kept in a separate repository.

## Steps

>[!note] Clone Repository
>```shell
>git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
>cd quartz
>npm i
>npx quartz create
>```

>[!note] Add Git Submodule
>Add [[Git Submodules|Git Submodule]] as content:
>1. Go in Quartz directory
>2. Run: 
>	```shell
>	git submodule add https://github.com/username/repo.git content/vault
>	git commit -m "Added a new submodule for obsidian notes"
>	```
>	
>>[!warning]- How to update the content
>>1. Go in Obsidian vault, commit and push all changers

>2. Then, run the following commands, replacing `REMOTE-URL` with the URL of your new repository.

>	git remote -v
>	```
>	
>	 ```shell
>	# if the origin doesn't match your own repository, set your repository as the origin
>	git remote set-url origin REMOTE-URL
>	 ```
