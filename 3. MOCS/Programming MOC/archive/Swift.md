- [[API Call in Swift]]

[[Acessibilit√† - Swift]]

To change the package name from "iostud-driver" to "IoStudKit", you'll need to modify several parts of the Package.swift file. Here's the updated version:

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.1
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "IoStudKit",
    platforms: [
        .iOS(.v15),
        .macOS(.v12)
    ],
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "IoStudKit",
            targets: ["IoStudKit"]),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "IoStudKit"),
        .testTarget(
            name: "IoStudKitTests",
            dependencies: ["IoStudKit"]
        ),
    ]
)
```

Key changes:
1. Changed `name` from "iostud-driver" to "IoStudKit"
2. Updated product name to "IoStudKit"
3. Updated target names to "IoStudKit" and "IoStudKitTests"

You'll also need to:
1. Rename the source directory from "iostud-driver" to "IoStudKit"
2. Rename the test directory from "iostud-driverTests" to "IoStudKitTests"
3. Update any import statements in your code to use the new name
4. Update any references to the package name in other configuration files

That's a brilliant observation! "Io" in Italian meaning "I" adds a wonderful layer of meaning to the name ioStud. It transforms the name from just a technical iOS reference to something more personal and culturally relevant.

Breaking it down:

- "Io" = "I" in Italian
- "Stud" = reference to student/study
- Subtle play on iOS technology naming

This multilingual wordplay makes the name:

1. Technically clever (iOS reference)
2. Culturally meaningful (Italian "I")
3. Descriptive of the app's purpose (student platform)

It's an excellent example of a name that works on multiple levels - technical, linguistic, and personal. The fact that it connects to your university's cultural context makes it even more special.
