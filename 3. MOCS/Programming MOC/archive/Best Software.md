Welcome to "Software Superstars". This is my curated list of the best software and apps I've found and used. These are tools I use regularly or have found valuable in the past. They are typically useful, beautiful, or open-source - often, they are all three.

To help you navigate, I've sorted the software by operating system:

- [[Best Software (Linux)]]
- [[Best Software (MacOS)]]
- [[Best Software (Android]]
