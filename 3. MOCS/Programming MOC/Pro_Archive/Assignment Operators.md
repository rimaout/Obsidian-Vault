## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used in Java to assign values to variables. 

```java
int age;
age = 5;
```

| Operator | Example   | Equivalent to |
| -------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `=`      | `a = b;`  | `a = b;`      |
| `+=`     | `a += b;` | `a = a + b;`  |
| `-=`     | `a -= b;` | `a = a - b;`  |
| `*=`     | `a *= b;` | `a = a * b;`  |
| `/=`     | `a /= b;` | `a = a / b;`  |
| `%=`     | `a %= b;` | `a = a % b;`  |
