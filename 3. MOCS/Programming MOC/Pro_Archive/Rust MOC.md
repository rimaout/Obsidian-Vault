## What is Rust?

- **Platform Independent** - You can compile a Rust program on one platform and run it on another platform.
- **Performance** - Rust is one of the fastest programming languages. Not only that, but it also requires less memory, which makes it a highly efficient language.
- **Safe Concurrency** - Rust doesn't allow programs to modify the same value simultaneously while running the concurrent program.
- **Memory Safety** - Rust also provides memory safety to prevent unexpected crashes of its program.
