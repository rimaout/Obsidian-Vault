The `sizeof` operator is used to determine the size of a variable or data type in bytes.

## Syntax:
```c
sizeof(variable or data type)
```

## Example:
int x = 5; size_t size_of_x = sizeof(x); printf("The size of x is %zu bytes\n", size_of_x);

Here, we use `sizeof` to determine the size of the integer variable `x`, and store the result in the `size_of_x` variable. We then print the size of `x` using `printf()`.

---
## Benefits:
Using `sizeof` can help with memory management, as it allows us to allocate the correct amount of memory for variables and data types. It can also help with understanding the layout of data structures in memory.

## Usage:

**Determine the size of a variable:**
```c
int x = 5; size_t size_of_x = sizeof(x);
```

**Determine the size of a data type:**
```c
size_t size_of_int = sizeof(int);
```

**Determine the size of an array:**
```c
int arr[10]; size_t size_of_arr = sizeof(arr);
```

**Determine the size of a struct:**
```c
struct my_struct {   int x;   double y; }; 
size_t size_of_struct = sizeof(struct my_struct);
```
