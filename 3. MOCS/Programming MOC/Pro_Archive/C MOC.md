## What is C?
1. C is a **general-purpose** programming language that was originally developed in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.
2. C is a **compiled language**, meaning that the code is translated into machine code by a compiler before it can be executed.
3. C is a **low-level language**, which means that it provides a great deal of control over hardware resources and memory management.
4. C is a **procedural language**, which means that it focuses on writing functions or procedures that perform specific tasks.
5. C is a **strongly typed** language, which means that every variable must be declared with a specific data type before it can be used.
6. C supports **pointers**, which are variables that hold memory addresses.
