Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is `true` or `false`. They are used in decision making.

| Operator           | Example                        | Meaning                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `&&` (Logical AND) | expression1 **&&** expression2 | `true` only if both expression1 and expression2 are `true` |
| `\|` (Logical OR)  | expression1 **\|** expression2 | `true` if either expression1 or expression2 is `true`      |
| `!` (Logical NOT)  | **!**expression                | `true` if expression is `false` and vice versa             |
