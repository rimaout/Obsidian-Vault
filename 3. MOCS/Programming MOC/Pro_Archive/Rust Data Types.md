We use data types in Rust to determine the type of data associated with the variables. For example,

```
let alphabet: char;
```

Here, `char` is the data type that specifies that the alphabet variable can only store the character data.

## Scalar types
A _scalar_ type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:

- [[Rust Integers|Integer]]
- [[Rust Floating-Point|Floating-Point]]
- [[Rust Booleans|Boolean]]
- [[Rust Characters |Character]]

---
## Compound types
_Compound types_ can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types:

- [[Rust Tuples|Tuples]]
- [[Rust Arrays|Arrays]]
