# Unordered Objects In Python

- Unordered object **don't have an index** for their elements, this means that you can not slice or index them.
- Unordered object **don't allow the repetition** of elements

In Python, there are two built-in unordered collection objects:

1.  **Sets:** A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor. For example:

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
```

1.  **Dictionaries:** A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons `:`. For example:

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
```

In addition to these built-in objects, Python also has several third-party libraries that provide additional unordered collection objects, such as `defaultdict`, `Counter`, and `OrderedDict` from the `collections` module.
