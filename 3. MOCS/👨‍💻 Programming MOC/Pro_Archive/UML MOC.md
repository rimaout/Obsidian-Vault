Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardised, general-purpose visual modeling language in the field of software engineering. It's particularly useful for designing and documenting systems written in object-oriented programming language (like [[Java MOC|Java]]).

UML includes several types of diagrams to represent different aspects of a system, including:

- [[UML Class Diagrams]]: Show the static structure of the system's classes, their internal structure, and their relationships to each other. 
- [[UML Sequence diagrams]]: Show how processes operate with one another and in what order.
- [[UML Use case diagrams]]: Show the interaction between the system and its users.
- [[UML Activity diagrams]]: Show the sequential flow of control between different activities in a system.
