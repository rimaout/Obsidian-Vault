## 🕹️ September 2024

I spent most of the month programming in Java, specifically working on a remake of the classic game [Bubble Bobble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble) for a university project. Now that the month is over, I can say that the game is functionally complete, but before I can submit the project to my professor, I still need to complete the implementation of the MVC design pattern and write the project [[Relazione Bubble Bobble|report]]. 

Honestly, this was my first time working on something this big, and it's been a really rewarding experience. I learned a ton and I'm really happy with the result. However, it's also been really stressful - at times even miserable - due to the fact that it was such a big project and my first time working with a deadline and project requirements that weren't chosen by me.

Talking of less serious things, I recently discovered a **really great** project called [hardcover.app](https://hardcover.app/). It’s a **beautiful** social platform designed to help users keep track of the books they’ve read and share them with the world. The project is created by a solo developer and is community-funded. He also has an interesting [blog](https://hardcover.app/blog) where he shares the development journey of Hardcover! P.S. this is my profile [@TheSpaceAlchemist](https://hardcover.app/@TheSpaceAlchemist).

**What I'm reading:** Started reading [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://hardcover.app/books/the-ultimate-hitchhikers-guide) for the first time.
