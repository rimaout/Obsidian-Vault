**To-Do:** Scrivi della prima stella su Github e del fatto che il sito esce su Duckduck go, metti screen e test della velocitÃ , aggiorna colore bolditalic e italic, centra immagini, e fai guida. scrivi che non utilizzi mai l'italic quindi lo utilizzerai come evidenziatore.

**What I'm reading:**

**Video of the Month:** This time I'm not sharing just a Youtube video but an entire channel.

**[ProjectKamp](https://www.youtube.com/@ProjectKamp)** has been one of my favorite YouTube channels over the past few years. They are a group of people from all over the word coming together to try to find another way to live, one that is more in harmony with our environment. In short, they've purchased a plot of land in Portugal and are documenting their journey as they work to create a sustainable community. The coolest part that everything is documented and open source.

From each of their videos, I learn a lot and have fun - it's also extremely addictive to see the camp grow and improve week by week. There's something inspiring about watching a community come together and thrive, and ProjectKamp's videos always leave me feeling motivated and enthusiastic.

If you're intrigued by this project, I suggest starting with their [first video of this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vai5Uc_HC_A), which provides a recap of their progress over the past three years. If you like what you see, be sure to go back and watch their old videos tarting from the [first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub-I2m2PWAA).

>P.S. Their website, community platform and much more is all open source on [their Github](https://github.com/ONEARMY).
