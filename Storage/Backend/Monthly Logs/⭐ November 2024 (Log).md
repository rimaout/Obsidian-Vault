#### Site Update

This moth I had fun modifying and messing around with this site. Thanks to my DevOps skills, I managed to break the site multiple times, but I’m happy to report that everything is now up and running "smoothly".

Here are some of the changes I made to the text formatting:

- ***Text Color Change:*** I updated the color of bold text from white (or black) to **this**.
- ***Italic Text:*** I can now use italic text to highlight important points, like _this_.
- ***Bold Italic Text:*** The bold italic text now appears as _**this**_.

I really like these text styles, as they make my notes much more readable.

In addition to these text modifications, I also center-aligned the images on the site, thanks to suggestions from [@alessio](https://github.com/alem1105). 
I was also able to add a site icon at the beginning of the site title, which enhances the overall look!

I’ve documented the entire process in two guides: [[How to add custom icon to site title - Quartz|how to add an icon on the title]] and [[Quartz custom CSS|how I changed the text formatting]].

As someone who doesn’t have much experience with CSS, HTML, or web development in general, For these modifications I relied heavily on the support of my friend [@alessio](https://github.com/alem1105) and the wonderful community in the [Quartz Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/cRFFHYye7t).

This month, I discovered that if you search for the site on _Google_ or _DuckDuckGo_, you will find it in the search results. I have zero knowledge of SEO, but from what I understand, this site has a unique enough name. I have also followed most SEO rules, such as not using overly heavy images and ensuring high text readability (with good text contrast and font choices). In general, [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) does a good job of handling SEO things on its own.

Using [pagespeed](https://duckduckgo.com/pagespeed.web.dev) to test the site's speed, I discovered that I can achieve even better performance by optimizing image sizes and converting them to more efficient web formats, such as WebP and AVIF.

#### What I'm reading

Not much has changed since my [[🏫 October 2024 (Log)|last log]]. I'm still reading [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://hardcover.app/books/the-ultimate-hitchhikers-guide), but I've slowed my pace and have only read about 100 pages since then. As painful as it is to admit, I don’t think I’ll be able to finish the book. My interest peaked around page 300, and I don’t see myself making it to the end of the series.

What makes this book so special is its humor and the copious amount of absurdity. I believe that this is its greatest strength, but at the same time, it’s also its biggest weakness. In fact, the complete randomness of certain events, in the long run, makes the plot too chaotic, leaving me with a sense of a lack of clear direction.

Honestly, I love how Douglas Adams is able to characterize extremely funny and absurd characters in just a few lines. Each chapter introduces a new character to discover, which is truly fascinating. No other book has ever made me laugh this much, while at the same time leaving me wondering how on earth he came up with certain ideas.

But sadly, the length of the story is a challenge for me. I would probably adore a book that tells many short stories set in a similar universe.

I guess it just wasn't my cup of Nutri-Matic.

If you are thinking to read this classic collection of sci-fi books go a head, I really think that especially the first book is worth the read, even more if you want to know the answer to the *Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything*.

But if you are an uneducated Vogon and want to know the answer without reading the book, here it is:

>[!quote]- The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything (SPOILER)
>
>Keep in mind that the plot of _Hitchhiker's Guide_ spends most of two chapters building up to this moment.
>
>There are descriptions of the majesty of the supercomputer named Deep Thought (which occupies an entire city), the initial disappointment as the researchers discover that the answer will take several million years to compute... and then we come to...
>
>>"Good morning," said Deep Thought at last.
>>
>>"Er... Good morning, O Deep Thought," said Loonquawl nervously, "do you have... er, that is..."
>>
>>"An answer for you?" interrupted Deep Thought majestically. "Yes. I have."
>>
>>The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain.
>>
>>"There really is one?" breathed Phouchg.
>>
>>"There really is one," confirmed Deep Thought.
>>
>>"To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything?"
>>
>>"Yes."
>>
>>Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children.
>>
>>"And you're ready to give it to us?" urged Loonquawl.
>>
>>"I am."
>>
>>"Now?"
>>
>>"Now," said Deep Thought.
>>
>>They both licked their dry lips.
>>
>>"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought, "that you're going to like it."
>>
>>"Doesn't matter!" said Phouchg. "We must know it! Now!"
>>
>>"Now?" inquired Deep Thought.
>>
>>"Yes! Now..."
>>
>>"Alright," said the computer and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.
>>
>>"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought.
>>
>>"Tell us!"
>>
>>"Alright," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great Question..."
>>
>>"Yes...!"
>>
>>"Of Life, the Universe and Everything..." said Deep Thought.
>>
>>"Yes...!"
>>
>>"Is..." said Deep Thought, and paused.
>>
>>"Yes...!"
>>
>>"Is..."
>>
>>"Yes...!!!...?"
>>
>>"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.

#### Video of the Month

This time I'm not sharing just a Youtube video but an entire channel.

**[ProjectKamp](https://www.youtube.com/@ProjectKamp)** has been one of my favorite YouTube channels over the past few years. They are a group of people from all over the word coming together to try to find another way to live, one that is more in harmony with our environment. In short, they've purchased a plot of land in Portugal and are documenting their journey as they work to create a sustainable community. The coolest part that everything is documented and open source.
- [ProjectKamp - Website](https://projectkamp.com/index.html)
- [ProjectKamp - Research & Documentation](https://community.projectkamp.com/research?sort=LatestUpdated) 

From each of their videos, I learn a lot and have fun - it's also extremely addictive to see the camp grow and improve week by week. There's something inspiring about watching a community come together and thrive, and ProjectKamp's videos always leave me feeling motivated and enthusiastic.

If you're intrigued by this project, I suggest starting with their [first video of this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vai5Uc_HC_A), which provides a recap of their progress over the past three years. If you like what you see, be sure to go back and watch their old videos tarting from the [first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub-I2m2PWAA).

>P.S. Their website, community platform are open source on [their Github](https://github.com/ONEARMY).

#### Other things that made my November

- Kebabs, precisely 5 (I have a soft spot for falafel kebabs)
- Arcane: I loved the animation style, finding it incredibly innovative and beautiful. My favorite action scene from the series is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fqLlnlcFFw). What also stood out to me was the depth of the characters and their genuine motivations. The line between good and evil is so blurred that I often found myself empathizing with the "bad guys," which I really appreciated.
- I received my first star ⭐ on Github from someone outside of my friend circle, thanks [@PiotrEsse](https://github.com/PiotrEsse) for liking my [fact2mp3](https://github.com/rimaout/flac2mp3) repo.
