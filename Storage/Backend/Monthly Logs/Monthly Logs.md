## October 2024 🏫

This month, university restarted, and it was magical to finally see my friends again after weeks of studying together online. The campus was beautiful, with people studying, chatting, and enjoying life, I'm sure it won't be long, before everyone is stressed out again 😅.

Now that the exams are a distant memory, it's nice to have some time to relax and focus on the things that are important to me, like my relationships and taking care of myself.

Talking about deep and meaningful things, I recently had to completely rebuild this site after upgrading to the latest [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) version, which unfortunately broke my configuration. However, I took this opportunity to document the process of rebuilding it from scratch, so that next time I'll be better prepared for the worst. You can find the guide here: [[Quartz Setup]].

>P.S: luckily I documented the process because i broke the site again!!

**What I'm reading:** I'm still reading [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://hardcover.app/books/the-ultimate-hitchhikers-guide). 

Now that the month is ending, I've reached about one-third of the way through the 1000 pages, and if I finish it, it will be the longest book I've ever read!
So far, I really like the story, but the thing I find most fascinating is how Douglas Adams, the author of this book, is able to craft such unique and crazy characters.
