-- ðŸš§ work in progress, come back at the end of the month ðŸš§ --

This month, university restarted, and it was magical to finally see my friends again after weeks of studying together online. The campus was beautiful, with people studying, chatting, and enjoying life, I'm sure it won't be long, before everyone is stressed out again ðŸ˜….

Now that the exams are a distant memory, it's nice to have some time to relax and focus on the things that are important to me, like my relationships and taking care of myself.

Talking about deep and meaningful things, I recently had to completely rebuild this site after upgrading to the latest [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) version, which unfortunately broke my configuration. However, I took this opportunity to document the process, so that next time I'll be better prepared for the worst. You can find the guide here: [[Quartz Setup]].
