## September 2024

- I discovered a **really great** project called [hardcover.app](https://hardcover.app/). It’s a **beautiful** social platform designed to help users keep track of the books they’ve read and share them with the world. The project is created by a solo developer and is community-funded. He also has an interesting [blog](https://hardcover.app/blog) where he shares the development journey of Hardcover! P.S. this is my profile [@TheSpaceAlchemist](https://hardcover.app/@TheSpaceAlchemist).

**What I'm reading:** Started reading [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://hardcover.app/books/the-ultimate-hitchhikers-guide) for the first time.

**Video of the Month:** [This $30 Camera Is Truly Special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTyRiO08xi8) by [Mr Chops](https://www.youtube.com/@mrchops)
