ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my monthly log! This is a space that serves as a way to keep track of and document what I do and experience throughout the year. 

Here, Iâ€™ll share updates on my projects, the books Iâ€™m reading, my university journey, and everything I feel comfortable sharing with you.

## September 2024

- Started reading [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://hardcover.app/books/the-ultimate-hitchhikers-guide)
- I discovered a **really great** project called [hardcover.app](https://hardcover.app/). Itâ€™s a **beautiful** social platform designed to help users keep track of the books theyâ€™ve read and share them with the world. The project is created by a solo developer and is community-funded. He also has an interesting [blog](https://hardcover.app/blog) where he shares the development journey of Hardcover! This is my profile [@TheSpaceAlchemist](https://hardcover.app/@TheSpaceAlchemist).
