This is the place where I save the best recipes I have found and tried. The common factor between all the recipes is that I really, really like them and, most importantly, they are fast and easy to make.

- [[Recipe (Template)]]
- [[Nonna's Gnocchi]]
- [[Nonna's Pasta and Pumpkin]]


How I write the recipes: [[Recipes Markdown Formatting]]
