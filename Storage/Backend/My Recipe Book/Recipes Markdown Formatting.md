These are not rules or anything official for the sub.

**Photos**

1. For galleries, include position the finished pie as the first photo for a pretty thumbnail. You can also include that image a second time in the gallery.
    
2. Ideally, post a top down, bottom of crust, and a side of the crust (crumb). Process photos are great too.
    

**Ingredient Listing**

1. List ingredients in order of use
    
2. For grouped ingredients, list the most important first
    
3. Use complete names for measurements: tablespoons, ounces, etc
    
4. If there are different sections, separate them with a bolded title
    
5. Avoid using numerals together: e.g. 1 7g sachet of yeast. Instead, use 1 (7 gram) sachet of yeast
    
6. Include both volumetric and weight measurements for ingredients
    
7. For simple preparations, describe it in the list; e.g. 1 stick butter, softened
    
8. Include a list of tools used -- large mixing bowl, food processor, wooden pizza peel, aluminum pizza peel, baking steel, etc.
    
9. If you want to include Baker's percentages, that'd be fantastic. This helps for anyone scaling the recipe up or down.
    

**Method**

1. Indicate the size of bowls and cookware
    
2. Stick to short points over full sentences
    
3. If there are different sections, separate them with a bolded title
    
4. Group similar processes like 'mix dry ingredients' into a single paragraph
    
5. Indicate times when applicable
    
6. Finish off your initial method with storage instructions. For example, 'store for three days in the refrigerator in a lightly oiled bowl with saran wrap' or whatever.
    

**Using Markdown**

For tables, there won't be any lines between the header and cells. Sadly, reddit won't let me format this markdown as pre-formatted text.

| Ingredient  | Measurement, Weight | Notes                           |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Bread Flour | 1153 grams          | Pref. King Arthur or Robin Hood |
| Water (58%) | 670 grams           | Room Temperature                |
